		<h1>JGenHtml - Code Coverage Report</h1>
		<hr/>
			<h2>Viewing the report</h2>
			JGenHtml produces two versions of the same report:
			<ol>
				<li><a href="xml/index.xml">XML + XSLT</a></li>
				<li><a href="html/index.html">HTML</a></li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Why are there two versions and when to use which?</h2>
			<p>Ideally there would be only one version, the XML + XSLT version. The main advantages of this format over HTML are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The XML pages are smaller than the corresponding HTML versions.</li>
				<li>XML is both human and machine readable.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The problem with client side XSLT is that support for it on the "file:" protocol is problematic in many browsers.</p>
			<p>You can use either version anywhere, but the HTML version would be best on the "file:" protocol while the XML version would be best over http.</p>
			<p>Note: to support client side XSLT on the "file:" protocol the Google Chrome browser needs to be started with the command line flag <code>--allow-file-access-from-files</code></p>
